name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with clear structure and naming, adding minimal, helpful, evergreen comments only for large sections of complex logic, avoiding comments about recent changes or temporary fixes. Use this skill when writing or reviewing code in any file where comments or code documentation are involved. Apply when deciding whether to add comments, when refactoring code to be more self-explanatory through better naming and structure, when reviewing existing comments for relevance and evergreen quality, when removing outdated or change-related comments, or when adding concise explanatory comments for complex logic sections. Use for any task involving code documentation strategy, comment quality assessment, or improving code readability through structure rather than comments.
