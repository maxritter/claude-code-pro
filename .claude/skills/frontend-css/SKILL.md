# Frontend CSS

## When to use this skill

- When writing or modifying CSS files (.css, .scss, .sass, .less, .module.css)
- When applying utility classes in Tailwind CSS or similar utility-first frameworks
- When implementing CSS-in-JS or styled-components in React/Vue/Svelte components
- When defining or using design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
- When maintaining consistency with the project's CSS methodology (BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS, utility-first)
- When optimizing CSS for production with purging or tree-shaking unused styles
- When avoiding excessive framework style overrides by working with framework patterns
- When implementing global styles or theme configurations
- When refactoring inline styles or scattered CSS into organized, maintainable patterns
- When establishing or following CSS naming conventions for the project

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend CSS.

## Instructions

- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply and stick to the project's consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules, etc.) across the entire project
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: Work with your framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides
- **Maintain Design System**: Establish and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverage framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for production with CSS purging/tree-shaking to remove unused styles
