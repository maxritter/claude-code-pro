name: Global Tech Stack
description: Define and reference the project's technical stack including frameworks, languages, databases, testing tools, deployment platforms, and third-party services to maintain consistency across development. Use this skill when setting up new projects, configuring build tools, installing dependencies, writing code that needs to align with framework conventions, selecting libraries or tools, documenting the tech stack, or ensuring consistency with the project's chosen technologies. Apply when working with framework-specific files, configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.), deployment configurations, or when making architectural decisions about which tools and libraries to use. Use for any task involving technology selection, framework usage, library integration, or tech stack documentation.

# Global Tech Stack

## When to use this skill

- When setting up a new project or initializing the development environment
- When configuring build tools, package managers, or development dependencies
- When selecting frameworks, libraries, or tools that align with the project's stack
- When writing code that needs to follow framework-specific conventions and patterns
- When documenting the technical stack in README or architecture documentation
- When making decisions about which ORM, testing framework, or CSS framework to use
- When configuring deployment platforms or CI/CD pipelines
- When integrating third-party services (authentication, email, monitoring)
- When ensuring consistency with established technology choices across the codebase
- When updating or maintaining the project's dependency list and tech stack documentation

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global tech stack.
