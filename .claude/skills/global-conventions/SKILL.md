name: Global Conventions
description: Follow consistent project structure, clear documentation, version control best practices, environment configuration, dependency management, code review processes, and feature flag usage for maintainable team development. Use this skill when organizing project files and directories, writing or updating documentation (README files, architecture docs, contribution guidelines), managing dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile), configuring environment variables, implementing feature flags, writing commit messages, creating pull/merge requests, or establishing team development workflows. Apply when setting up project structure, documenting setup instructions, managing configuration files, maintaining changelogs, or implementing development conventions. Use for any task involving project organization, team collaboration standards, or development workflow best practices.

# Global Conventions

## When to use this skill

- When organizing project files and directories or establishing project structure
- When writing or updating README files, setup instructions, or architecture documentation
- When managing dependencies in package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, or similar files
- When configuring environment variables or creating .env.example files
- When implementing feature flags for incomplete features to avoid long-lived branches
- When writing commit messages following project conventions
- When creating pull requests or merge requests with clear descriptions
- When maintaining changelogs or release notes for version tracking
- When establishing or following code review processes and expectations
- When documenting contribution guidelines for team members
- When keeping dependencies up-to-date and minimal, documenting major dependency choices

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global conventions.

## Instructions

- **Consistent Project Structure**: Organize files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README files with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
- **Version Control Best Practices**: Use clear commit messages, feature branches, and meaningful pull/merge requests with descriptions
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration; never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimal; document why major dependencies are used
- **Code Review Process**: Establish a consistent code review process with clear expectations for reviewers and authors
- **Testing Requirements**: Define what level of testing is required before merging (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for incomplete features rather than long-lived feature branches
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Keep a changelog or release notes to track significant changes and improvements
