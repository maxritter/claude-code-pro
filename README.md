## 🎯 What is Claude Code Pro?

**Claude Code Pro** is a battle-tested, production-ready configuration for Claude Code that incorporates industry best practices, advanced workflows, and powerful integrations. This free setup gives professional developers everything they need to leverage Claude Code's full potential on real-world projects.

**Stop "vibing" code. Start shipping production-grade software.**

### 🌟 The Problem We Solve

Most developers use Claude Code as a smart autocomplete tool. But Claude Code can be so much more:
- ❌ Ad-hoc coding without proper testing
- ❌ No structured workflow for complex features
- ❌ Missing integrations with essential dev tools
- ❌ No knowledge persistence across sessions
- ❌ Inefficient model usage (burning tokens unnecessarily)

### ✨ The Claude Code Pro Solution

- ✅ **Test-Driven Development** enforced through automated skills
- ✅ **Structured workflows** for features of any complexity
- ✅ **25+ MCP integrations** (AWS, Postgres, Playwright, and more)
- ✅ **Cross-session memory** with Cipher knowledge base
- ✅ **Optimized model usage** (Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution)
- ✅ **Production-ready practices** out of the box
